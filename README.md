This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to loose comparisons.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison.  Loose comparison (==) in PHP can lead to unexpected behavior due to type juggling.  Always prefer strict comparison (===) for reliable comparisons to avoid this type of error.
